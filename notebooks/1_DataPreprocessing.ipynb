    "Financial institutions must assess the risk associated with lending money to individuals. Incorrect credit decisions can lead to significant financial losses or missed business opportunities.\n",

    "In this project, we build an end-to-end machine learning system to assess credit risk by predicting whether a borrower is likely to fully repay a loan or not, based on historical loan and borrower information.\n",

    "The task is formulated as a binary classification problem, with an additional focus on estimating the probability of non-repayment to support risk-aware decision making."
